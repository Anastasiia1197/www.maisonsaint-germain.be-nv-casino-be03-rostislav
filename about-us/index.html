        <h2>How We Test Levels, Maps, and Game Modes</h2>
        <p class="txt">
            Our team employs a rigorous testing methodology to evaluate all aspects of Nine Casino's gaming offerings. We systematically analyze each game's mechanics, payout structures, bonus features, and overall player experience.

        <p class="txt">
            For slot games, we examine RTP (Return to Player) percentages, volatility levels, bonus frequency, and max win potential. Table games are evaluated based on rule variations, house edge, and gameplay smoothness. Live dealer games are assessed for stream quality, dealer professionalism, game variety, and betting limits. We document our findings in detailed reports that form the basis of our game reviews and recommendations for Canadian players.
