            The cookies we use collect anonymous information about your browsing behavior, device type, and approximate location (to ensure we comply with Canadian regulations). 
            This may include pages visited, games played, and time spent on our platform. We strictly use this data to improve our services, personalize content,

            Nine Casino works with trusted third-party service providers who may also place cookies on your device. These include analytics companies that help us understand website usage, 
            payment processors that ensure secure transactions, and advertising partners that show you relevant promotions. All third-party cookies are subject to strict data processing agreements 
            that require them to protect your information and use it only for the purposes we specify. We regularly review our partners' privacy practices to ensure they meet our high standards.
