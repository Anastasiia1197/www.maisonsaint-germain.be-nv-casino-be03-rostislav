        <p class="txt">
            At Nine Casino, we prioritize the privacy and security of our Canadian players' personal information. 
            This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use our services. 
            We are committed to maintaining transparency and ensuring that your information is handled responsibly 
            in accordance with Canadian privacy laws and international data protection standards.
        </p>

        <h2>What data we collect and how it powers your experience</h2>
        <p class="txt">
            Nine Casino collects necessary information to provide you with a seamless gaming experience and personalized services. 
            When you register an account, we collect basic personal details such as your name, email address, date of birth, and contact information. 
            As you use our platform, we may also collect data about your gaming preferences, transaction history, device information, and IP address. 
            This information helps us customize your experience, process transactions efficiently, and ensure the security of your account.
        </p>

        <p class="txt">
            Cookies play a vital role in enhancing your experience at Nine Casino. These small text files help us remember your preferences, 
            maintain your session security, and analyze how you interact with our platform. We use both session cookies (which expire when you close your browser) 
            and persistent cookies (which remain on your device for a set period). Cookies enable features like saved game progress, personalized bonuses, 
            and language preferences. You can manage your cookie settings through your browser, though disabling them may affect certain platform functionalities.
        </p>

            These partners include payment processors, verification services, marketing agencies, and cloud hosting providers. 
            We ensure all third parties adhere to strict confidentiality agreements and implement robust security measures. 
            In certain circumstances, we may also disclose information when required by law or to protect our rights, property, or safety.
